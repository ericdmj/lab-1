I have only worked myself through 1-3 Lesson 2, so I still have to tackle the SVG stuff, which I'll do mostly later this week (taking a four-day weekend!).  I'll also refine the content on the web page, which I've only started to sketch out here. Lots of styling to do, too!


Question 1
I do have one main semi-related question from Lesson 2, though.  It's less pertinent for the lab because the lab moves on in Lesson 3, but I'm still curious:

I couldn't for the life of me get the III. Temporal Legend to work in 1-3 Lesson 2, which says "Rather than walking through all the steps here, we will let you adapt script for the popups to populate the temporal legend."  I did get it to work as you can see, but that was by going ahead to Lesson 3 and seeing how they created the temporal legend label, which was very different I think than the suggestion here in section III of Lesson 2.  

My key question here is: is it possible to use the year that is generated in the PopupContent function directly, or do I need to create a new function for the new legend?  I'm going to try some more to generate a temporal legend using the existing scripts in Lesson 2 before moving onto the simpler one from Lesson 3, with the updatePropSymbols year info. (Unless that *is* the solution from Lesson 2! It just seems to use much less code than I'd have expected!)  If there are any hints about which elements from the scripts in Lesson 2 I should really look at, I'd be interested in trying it out.


Question 2
Is there a way to tell which basemap at the Leaflet Providers site (https://leaflet-extras.github.io/leaflet-providers/preview/) are free and open?  Is it just the OSM ones?


Otherwise, any thoughts on my map work or page design is very welcome--many thanks!
